            Women Voices I Facilitate Violence against Women and Girls Training
            and also conducts mentorship for adolescent girls and young women.
            My way of advocacy is through empowerment and social inclusion. I
            believe everyone has the right to live a life free from fear and
            discrimination. For this to be achieved young women and girls from
            all diversities have to be integrated into all programs as well as
            equipped with relevant information and skills for them to make their
            own informed decisions. This is the only sustainable way of
            advocating and emancipating humans. I believe in young people
            because they have the voice and power to shape the future.

          <p>
            Marylize Biubwa is a 30 year old black queer intersectional feminist
            and activist. Her activism is on social justice with a deliberate
            gender bias. Her feminism, as indicated above is intersectional in
            nature to allow for championing for the rights of all humans. Her
            activism and feminism are inspired by life experiences and
            day-to-day events that make life. As a rape survivor, her motivation
            to activism and feminism is to see a world where women are free to
            express and explore their sexuality and femininity without being
            sexually objectified, for women to have a voice and choice over
            their bodies(bodily autonomy), and for consent to be a bare minimum
            when it comes to female interactions with males. Her ideal world is
            a world where a level ground is maintained for all genders, sexual
            orientations and identities to ever exist under the sun.
