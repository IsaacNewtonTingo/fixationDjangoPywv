            We are in a society where <strong>Women and Girls are not safe</strong> anywhere and if we are to stand in solidarity, we have to pledge to do something to free women and girls from the shackles of Violence. At <strong>Positive Young Women Voices</strong> , we are currently conducting a project, <strong>"Preventing and Ending Violence against women and Girls"</strong> .We engage young women in their diversity within the phases in <strong>Dandora</strong>  including teenage mothers, survivors of Gender Based Violence and those most affected through trainingsâ€™ conducted bi-montly discussing root causes of Violence, principles of Gender and the impact it creates in women, girls and community at large from a range of perspectives. <br><br>

            In efforts of preventing and <strong>ending Violence against women and girls</strong> , we use a gender transformative intervention, involving young men and understanding the role they play as influencers and allies. We enhance victim/survivor centered response to Gender Based Violence by creating linkages with local authorities as well as referrals to the organizations and shelters responding to Gender Based Violence. <br> <br>

            We trend the <strong>#ItEndsWithUs</strong>  because we start a conversation, we believe the survivors, we empower and stand against violence against women and girls.
