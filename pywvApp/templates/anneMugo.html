                Anne is an intersectional feminist who uses her skills to lead and advocate for the rights of women and girls, driven by the belief that our freedoms are inter-connected and dependent on one another. At Positive Young Women Voices, Anne divides her time between leadership, programs, communication, engagement, and advocacy duties. She is a writer who enjoys reading and fostering new relationships.
