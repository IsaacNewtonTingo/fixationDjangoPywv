            We are implementing the <a href="https://hivos.org/program/we-lead/">We Lead  program</a> in partnership with like-minded CSOs working to capacity build young women rightsholder groups to take the driverâ€™s seat and effectively advocate for their sexual reproductive health and rights. Under this project, PYWV is working with young women living with HIV and young women who identify as LBTI as they advocate and rally duty bearers and the public alike to support and champion for inclusive, accessible and respectable rightsholder tailored SRHR.
