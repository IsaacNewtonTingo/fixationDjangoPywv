            My mother once had told me that when she was starting periods, she
            was clueless that this would happen. Nobody had told her about it.
            She was shocked and thought, she might have a horrible disease. That
            was the early 1950s in Germany.

            <br />
            <br />
            A coincidence brought me to a panel discussion for the “World
            Menstrual Hygiene Day 2019” held in Berlin. Since 2014, every year
            28th May is dedicated to raising awareness of menstruation issues
            and challenges facing many women and gilrs. Well, it was as
            incidental as many things happening to us. I had met a young woman
            in Kenya -Lucy Wanjiku- who founded Positive Young Women Voices, an
            organisation working to bring more awareness about the issue in
            Dandora. In Dandora, as in many other places, many girls and young
            women cannot attend school during their period, because they are too
            poor to afford sanitary towels. I was not aware of that problem and
            as I am a journalist, I quite immediately thought about doing a
            report about the work of that Kenyan woman and about the issue in
            general.

            <br />
            <br />

            Many might question: “How can this guy not know about an ubiquitous
            topic like that, a topic that concerns directly half of the world
            population every month?” Well, think about, what you know about the
            weird male mind!

            <br />
            <br />

            Nevertheless, when I told female friends about my assignment, they
            reacted astonished, some with disbelief. “Why will you be on that
            panel?” some said. “What do you know about menstruation? You are a
            man!”

            <br />
            <br />

            I had to laugh a bit and explained the reason, why I was quite
            fitting in a discussion group about menstruation. Because, when you
            think about it, you find out that it is an issue that reflects, what
            is still not right in the relation between many men and women. The
            taboo around menstruation, the reluctance and ignorance many men
            show, when it comes to this issue, is an example of the inequality
            between genders. This inequality is the basis of a lot of harm, from
            unequal opportunities to sexual violence to femicide. A society,
            which believes in the fundamental right of equality between all
            human beings should be aware of these issues and talk openly about
            them.

            <br />
            <br />

            Some men (and women) might react with a certain insecurity, even
            fear, when it comes to talking about menstruation. If a taboo or a
            special treatment is put on a fact of life, it influences the
            thinking and feeling of everyone. Nevertheless, menstruation is a
            natural process, which deserves our knowledge and respect. It is a
            topic that should be talked about and taught to everyone, young and
            old, to dissolve a taboo into something normal. If you research
            about menstruation, wherever you live, you find out that in a lot of
            cultures it is linked to impurity, uncleanliness, even a certain
            danger. This is true for Western societies and for many Arab, Asian,
            African and South American societies. Most religions see
            menstruation as either a holy process or a process, which leads to
            the exclusion of women from religious practices and society for the
            time of their menstruation. Bloody hell! Isn’t that awkward?
            Something that is essential for the human cycle of life, without
            which no life would be (and not yours, fellow reader), is seen as
            something that has to be excluded or pushed out of our attention? If
            a woman does not want to talk about the issue with men, I fully
            understand. As most men (including me) have no clue about the pain
            and hormonal turmoil that can come with menstruation. Men don’t know
            about it as they never experienced it. Wouldn’t it be nice, if men
            developed some basic understanding without referring to simple
            reactions like “she is moody, she must have her period?”

            <br />
            <br />

            That is the more harmless, yet silly reaction. But if a society
            decided to exclude women from daily life, because of menstruation,
            this seems to overstep any idea of human equality and respect. If
            you research a bit, you find the idea that menstruation is, in some
            traditional societies, a phases, in which women are seen as
            something special. It is linked to a status of holiness. This was
            apparently turned around by most religions like Hinduism, Judaism,
            Christianism and Islam to the opposite, introducing the notion of
            impurity into menstruation. Women in their period should not go to
            the temple, church or mosque and were excluded from the social
            community for that time. I would understand and respect, if women
            decide for themselves that they want to be left in peace during that
            time due to the pain they suffer. But that is totally up for them to
            decide. Exclusion leads to a special treatment which can lead to a
            special kind of oppression – like female mutilation, which is a very
            sinister part of oppression of women. So, men have no say about that
            and should rather listen to women and understand, what they want.

            <br />
            <br />

            The taboo around menstruation leads to oppression of women and to
            the oppression of nature, which some societies are quite successful
            in. We should fully embrace nature and accept it, as long as it is
            not harmful to anyone. Those, who believe in inequality of men and
            women, might interpret menstruation as a proof to it. Those who
            don’t should reconsider their take on the issue. I believe in
            equality, as it is in my view the best way for peaceful, prosperous
            and happy societies. Therefore, every woman should get everything
            she needs to be an equal part of everyday life, also when they have
            their menstruation. Sanitary towels should be available everywhere
            and the lack of it should become a thing of the past. If women
            decide to take a time off during their menstruation, they should
            have the right to do so. And no man should perceive a woman as being
            weak during that time. Remember that nobody would live without a
            mother. Without a woman with menstruation. So, let’s fight against
            ignorance and exclusion. It is a fight against violence and
            oppression, a fight for a better world.
